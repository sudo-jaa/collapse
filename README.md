# collapse
An in-progress rust library for simulating star formation

## What?
I like to make games in my spare tim! I really enjoy projects that involve simulation, procedural generation, and other generative assets (looking at you, dwarf fortress!). I've been playing around with similar ideas - which I wanted to combine with my strange life-long obsession with space and astrophysics. 
Collapse is a work in progress that will hopefully provide you with all the tools you need to simulate the formation of stars for games of this genre that take place in space. 
It's not 100% scientifically accurate, but all the logic and formulae included are derived from as much scientific fact as I can reasonably deduce from the literature. 

## Why?
I like to teach myself about _stuff_. And the best way of learning for me has always been to implement it.
